// STREAMS 

// They are used to read or write sequentially
// Eg for big data files

// Four Types of Streams
// Writeable - used to write data sequentially
// Readable - used to read data sequentially
// Duplex - used to both read and write data sequentially
// Transform - used to modify data while writing or reading sequentially

// Streams extend events emitterclass
// meaning events like data and error can be used on streams
