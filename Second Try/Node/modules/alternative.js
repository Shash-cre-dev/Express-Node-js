module.exports.items = ['item1, item2']
const person = {
    name: 'bob'
}

module.exports.singlePerson = person

// ALTERNATIVE WAY
// you can create properties and assign them with using module.exports
// singlePerson is a property which is assigned with object person
// items is a property which is assigned with ['item1, item2'] which is an array
