How we exchange data on the Web?

Everytime we open a web browser and typing in an url or web address
, we are actually performing a request to the server which is responsible
for serving those resources. Server sends you the response, similar for data

It is done using http protocol and is known as HTTP messages. 
The user (Client) sends an http request message and the server sends the
http response. That's how we share data on the web.

Servers are computers who's main job is to make the resources available.
There are some differences like servers don't have GUI.
